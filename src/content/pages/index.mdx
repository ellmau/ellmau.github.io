*With over 12 years of academic expertise in AI, knowledge representation, and computational logic, I am passionate about bringing cutting-edge Computational Intelligence (CI) solutions to real-world challenges as I transition into new frontiers.*

I am transitioning into the industry, bringing over a decade of research and experience in higher education, computational complexity theory, mathematical logic, and knowledge representation and reasoning. I’m passionate about leveraging my expertise with AI and I am currently in the process of founding a company, helping others identify their specific needs for various techniques, including AI, and choose the right methods.

At Leipzig University (Intelligent Systems Group), I focused on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation, working on distributed reasoning and exchange of information.

At the Center of Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence ([ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai)), the International Center for Computational Logic ([ICCL](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de)), and the Knowledge-Based Systems [Group](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Wissensbasierte_Systeme/en), which are all part of TU Dresden, I focused on existential rules, argumentation theory, and ontology-based data access. There I have also been working at the industry-oriented [ITEA](https://itea4.org/) project [InnoSale](https://www.innosale.eu/consortium/) (Innovating Sales and Planning of Complex Industrial Products Exploiting Artificial Intelligence).

I led the development of a software bundle to **solve argumentation problems** using Binary Decision Diagrams and No-Good Learning methods. I’ve worked on the first steps for the in-memory datalog reasoning engine Nemo too.

I’m experienced in **managing IT Projects** with multiple partners from academia and industry and have a long history of **applying symbolic AI** and enabling others to understand and utilize such approaches.

## Academic education

I earned my B.Sc. in "Medicine and Computer Science" in 2009 and my diploma in "Computational Intelligence" in 2012, both from the Vienna University of Technology. In 2018, I defended my [doctoral thesis](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-214577) "Multi-Context Reasoning in Continuous Data-Flow Environments" under the supervision of Prof. [Gerhard Brewka](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~brewka/) at Leipzig University.


## Professional activities
My research interests include knowledge representation, logic programming, rule-based reasoning, multi-context reasoning, nonmonotonic reasoning, and (abstract) argumentation theory.

Currently, I am co-organizing the Fifth International Workshop on Systems and Algorithms for Formal Argumentation ([SAFA 2024](http://safa2024.argumentationcompetition.org/)). In the [InnoSale](https://www.innosale.eu/consortium/) project, I managed tasks to represent TU Dresden as the work package lead for implementation.

On the practical side, I focus on [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming and maintaining a robust production system based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org) with flakes. Check out my projects: [adf-obdd](https://stefan.ellmauthaler.net/adf-obdd/), my [NixOS setup](https://github.com/ellmau/nixos), and my solutions to all [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles on [GitHub](https://github.com/ellmau/adventofcode).

## Spare time
I voluntarily organized a weekly table tennis for employees as a Dresdner Hochschulsportzentrum ([DHSZ](https://tu-dresden.de/dhsz)) activity.
It invited players of all levels to have a 90 minutes lunch break filled with a fun sport.

[Jugger](https://jugger.org) is my second favourite sport, which I try to practice at least weekly.
It is a dynamic and agile team sport, combining strategic fencing elements with teamwork, where players aim to outmaneuver their opponents and score by placing a foam ball on the goal.

Alpine skiing is another occasional hobby of mine. I typically enjoy it during winter holidays in Austria.

I also have a large collection of Kickstarter-backed games, particularly enjoying exotic and complex titles.
