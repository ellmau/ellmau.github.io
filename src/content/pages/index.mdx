I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Knowledge-based Systems group](https://kbs.inf.tu-dresden.de/ste) of Prof. Dr. [Markus Kr√∂tzsch](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Markus_Kr%C3%B6tzsch) at TU Dresden. My position is funded by [ScaDS.AI](https://scads.ai) (Center for scalable data analytics and artificial intelligence) and the industry-focused [InnoSale](https://www.innosale.eu/consortium/) (Innovating Sales and Planning of Complex Industrial Products Exploiting Artificial Intelligence) project. 

I earned my B.Sc. in "Medicine and Computer Science" in 2009 and my diploma in "Computational Intelligence" in 2012, both from the Vienna University of Technology. In 2018, I defended my [doctoral thesis](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:15-qucosa2-214577) "Multi-Context Reasoning in Continuous Data-Flow Environments" under the supervision of Prof. [Gerhard Brewka](http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~brewka/) at Leipzig University.

## Professional activities
My research interests include knowledge representation, logic programming, rule-based reasoning, multi-context reasoning, nonmonotonic reasoning, and (abstract) argumentation theory. 

Currently, I am co-organizing the Fifth International Workshop on Systems and Algorithms for Formal Argumentation ([SAFA 2024](http://safa2024.argumentationcompetition.org/)). In the [InnoSale](https://www.innosale.eu/consortium/) project, I manage tasks to represent TU Dresden as the work package lead for implementation.

On the practical side, I focus on [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming and maintaining a robust production system based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org) with flakes. Check out my projects: [adf-obdd](https://stefan.ellmauthaler.net/adf-obdd/), my [NixOS setup](https://github.com/ellmau/nixos), and my solutions to all [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) puzzles on [GitHub](https://github.com/ellmau/adventofcode).

## Spare time
Voluntarily I offer a weekly table tennis for employees event as a Dresdner Hochschulsportzentrum ([DHSZ](https://tu-dresden.de/dhsz)) activity.
It is inviting players of all levels to have a 90 minutes lunch break filled with a fun sport.

[Jugger](https://jugger.org) is my second active sport, which I try to do at least weekly. Alpine skiing is some occassional hobby of mine.

Board games are yet another hobby of mine, where I really enjoy more exotic and complex games. I have a huge collection of kickstarter-campaign games as well.
