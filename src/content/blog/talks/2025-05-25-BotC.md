# Description

When a Game Night Becomes More Than Just a Game...

The Blood on the Clocktower night last Friday in Leipzig was a resounding success. With a small group of 8 to 12 people, we experienced several thrilling rounds of play. Strategy, tactics, spontaneous slip-ups, and a few last-minute decisions that completely turned the game around—everything was there. And fun was definitely not in short supply!

## Two Quotes I Had to Capture
Even without context, these two soundbites show just how intense (and amusing) the evening was:
💬 “Maybe you were lying the wrong way around, so left is the other left.”
💬 “I’d like to point out, you got the order of quantifiers wrong—you said we all don’t know, but I do know!”
As I’ve come to expect from nights like this, the conversations didn’t end with the final “move.” Discussions continued well past midnight—strategies were picked apart, new connections were made. A particularly nice aspect: Some of the participants hardly knew each other beforehand, and yet a genuine group feeling emerged quickly.

## The Bottom Line
All expectations were more than met. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, and there’s already been the first inquiry about the next event.
Who among you has ever experienced a game night that took totally unexpected turns? Or do you have a favorite moment from a round that still sticks with you today?

## A professional touch
The evening was not just a casual game night. Thoughtfully designed as the very first prototype for the workshop and moderation format, now presented at [echo-intelligence](https://www.echo-intelligence.at/produkte/teambuilding). Through the social deduction game “Blood on the Clocktower,” participants practiced key professional skills—including communication, strategic thinking, teamwork, and decision-making under pressure. This guided, experimental format provided a unique environment for reflection and exchange, ensuring enjoyment went hand in hand with the development of valuable interpersonal and collaborative competencies. The positive experience from this initial session became the blueprint for subsequent team-building concepts.
