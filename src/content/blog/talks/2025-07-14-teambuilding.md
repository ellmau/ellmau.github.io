# Description

How can team building and networking succeed in a playful and effective way?

Yesterday, I had the pleasure of demonstrating exactly that at the Unicorn Start-up & Innovation Hub in Graz.

I moderated a team-building and networking workshop based on social deduction principles, kindly hosted by the Unicorn team. Thanks also to Anna Theresa and Madlene for promoting the event—despite the usual summer break. The workshop began with a brief introduction to key negotiation methods and communication patterns. Immediately afterward, participants transitioned into rounds of **Blood on the Clocktower**, which provided a direct link between theoretical input and practical application. The informal, game-based setting encouraged participants to connect organically, forming and reforming groups throughout the session.

It is always inspiring to watch previously unacquainted attendees become increasingly interactive—over the course of the evening, I moderated four full games, each fostering new connections and teamwork. The response has been entirely positive.

**Why use social deduction games for team building?**
Blood on the Clocktower offers much more than entertainment: negotiation, teamwork, and conflict resolution are experienced and reflected upon in a safe, supportive environment—distinct from everyday business routines. Depending on the group’s focus, these dynamics can be further deepened during the debrief, ensuring relevant takeaways for future collaboration.

When was your last creative team-building experience? Who in your circle might enjoy such an event?
I look forward to your stories and recommendations! If you’re interested in joining a future session, don’t hesitate to get in touch.
