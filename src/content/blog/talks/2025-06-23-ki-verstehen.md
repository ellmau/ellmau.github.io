# Description

The two-part keynote talk “Understanding and Shaping AI” is aimed at fourth-year IT students. In the first 45 minutes (Parts 1–3), participants will receive an accessible overview of the development, fundamental concepts, and areas of application of artificial intelligence—from its historical beginnings to modern systems like ChatGPT. Using the speaker’s own career journey as an example, the talk illustrates how diverse and practical the path from an HTL education to a career in AI research and industry can be.

The second part (45 minutes, Part 4) centers on hands-on work with AI: participants will get to see how modern AI methods are applied as they work together to solve an engaging real-world problem with the help of answer set programming. The goal is for students not only to understand the foundations of AI in theory, but also to experience them in practice and discover new perspectives for their education and careers.

The talk emphasises directly: AI is more than just technology—it brings together mathematics, logic, and creativity, and opens up exciting opportunities for the future in IT and beyond.
